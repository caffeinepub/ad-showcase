## Summary
**Goal:** Build an ad display website with a public homepage showing active advertisements and an admin interface to manage ads.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend data model for advertisements with fields: id, title, description, imageUrl, targetUrl, and isActive status
- Implement homepage displaying all active ads in a responsive grid layout
- Build admin interface with forms to create, edit, toggle active/inactive, and delete advertisements
- Apply modern, professional visual theme with clean typography and cohesive color palette

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view active advertisements on the homepage in a grid layout and click ads to visit their target URLs. Administrators can manage advertisements through an admin interface with full CRUD operations.
